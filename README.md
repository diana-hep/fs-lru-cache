# HEPQuery

HEPQuery is a project to provide a fast, query-engine style interface to High Energy Physics (HEP) data. It's related to

   * [Femtocode](https://github.com/diana-hep/femtocode) query language<sup>*</sup>
   * [PLUR](https://github.com/diana-hep/plur) data representation

(<sup>*</sup> The Femtocode project is on hold while we develop the data representation and use [Numba-compiled Python](http://numba.pydata.org/) as a query language. Data representation should be independent of language for modularity.)

Here is an old poster describing the motivation and feasibility studies.
